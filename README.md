# PRODIGY_ML_01
Hi this is Ayush Singh and this is my repository for the tasks given to me by the IT company "PRODIGY INFOTECH" where i am currently working as a "MACHINE LEARNING INTERN". The ML_01 repository consists of the task 01.
Project Title: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the sale prices of houses based on various features. By utilizing Linear Regression, we aim to create a reliable and interpretable model that can assist real estate professionals and potential buyers in making informed decisions.

Project Description:
In this project, we develop a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using the Linear Regression algorithm. The dataset, obtained from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques," contains various features about houses, such as lot size, neighborhood, year built, and many others, along with the sale prices.

The project workflow includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the training and test datasets.
Explore the data to understand the features and their distributions.
Identify and handle missing values and outliers.
Data Preprocessing:

Separate numerical and categorical features.
Apply appropriate preprocessing steps: imputation for missing values, scaling for numerical features, and encoding for categorical features.
Ensure consistency in preprocessing between the training and test datasets.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might be relevant for predicting house prices.
Select the most significant features based on correlation analysis.
Model Development:

Define a Linear Regression model.
Create a pipeline combining preprocessing steps and the model.
Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Ensure the model's robustness and generalizability through cross-validation.
Prediction and Submission:

Preprocess the test dataset.
Make predictions on the test data using the trained pipeline.
Prepare the submission file for Kaggle by combining the predictions with the test data IDs.
The entire process is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, leveraging the power of Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NumPy.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on a rich dataset of house features. Through careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we were able to develop a predictive model with a high level of accuracy. The final model can provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate market, helping them make more informed decisions. This project also highlights the importance of consistent preprocessing and thorough evaluation in building reliable machine learning models.

By leveraging Linear Regression, we not only achieve good predictive performance but also maintain interpretability, which is crucial for understanding the influence of various features on house prices. The successful completion of this project underscores the potential of machine learning in transforming real-world problems into data-driven solutions.
